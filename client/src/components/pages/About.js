                <p>Descended from 2500 years of jewelry addicts, the Persian-American designer, Mona Assemi's <em> namesake brand </em> 
                    was founded in Washington DC. Currently residing in New York City, Mona's work combines sculptural clean lines, 
                    sumptuous crystals, and elegant metals. She creates a liquid dripping aesthetic frozen in time 
                    in the jewelry with an array of formulated acids for her signature ACIDS line. The unusual 14kt plated, 
                    silver plated, rose gold plated and <b>gunmetal</b> plated pieces have a chic sheen, yet distressed at the same time for 
                    the downtown meets uptown girl. Recent collections have included unusual shapes and sculptural protruding elements.
